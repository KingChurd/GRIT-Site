  <section class="faq-list">
    <details>
      <summary>Is GRIT a replacement for therapy?</summary>
      <p>
        No. GRIT is about daily habits, training, and reflection across the physical, mental, and
        spiritual pillars. It can support your work in therapy, but it does not replace licensed
        mental health care.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Who is GRIT for?</summary>
      <p>
        GRIT is built primarily for men who want to take ownership of their health, mindset, and
        identity, especially in busy, high-pressure seasons of life. If that resonates, you’re in
        the right place.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do I have to be in great shape to start?</summary>
      <p>
        No. Most GRIT content is built on the assumption that you’re starting from “real life”
        – tired, busy, and not perfectly dialed in. Start where you are and build slowly.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Is GRIT faith-based?</summary>
      <p>
        GRIT respects faith and spirituality and talks openly about purpose, identity, and values.
        Content is designed to work alongside your beliefs, not replace them.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How do the memberships work?</summary>
      <p>
        All tiers include the video + article library and the therapist finder. Higher tiers add
        challenges, tools, and coaching. You can read the breakdown on the
        <a href="pricing.html">Pricing page</a>.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can I cancel my membership?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes. You’ll be able to cancel before your next billing period and keep access until the
        end of your current cycle.
