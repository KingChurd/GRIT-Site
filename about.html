      <h1>About GRIT</h1>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        GRIT exists for men who want to become stronger in the ways that actually matter — not just
        physically, but mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, in the quiet places of life where
        no one else sees the work.
      </p>

      <div class="about-highlight">
        <p>
          This is not another hype-driven fitness brand or self-help cliché. GRIT is built for real
          men in real seasons of life — juggling work, school, family, faith, and everything in
          between.
        </p>
      </div>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Why GRIT Exists</h2>
      <div class="about-two-col">
        <p>
          Most men are carrying more than they talk about:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Work or school pressure</li>
          <li>Relationship and family stress</li>
          <li>Faith questions and identity shifts</li>
          <li>Anxiety, burnout, or emotional numbness</li>
          <li>The quiet weight of providing and protecting</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        We expect men to handle heavy responsibilities, but we rarely give them a healthy framework
        to grow into those responsibilities. GRIT exists to fill that gap — helping men build
        strength <strong>from the inside out</strong>, one realistic step at a time.
      </p>

      <h2>The Problem Men Face Today</h2>
      <div class="about-problem-grid">
        <article class="problem-card">
          <h3>“Man up. Don’t feel anything.”</h3>
          <p>
            This message leads to suppression, shame, emotional distance, and burnout. Men are told
            to carry everything but never shown how to process it.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="problem-card">
          <h3>“Just be soft and talk more.”</h3>
          <p>
            This message can ignore purpose, discipline, and the drive to face challenge. It can
            leave men unanchored, without structure or direction.
          </p>
        </article>
      </div>
      <p>
        Most men live in the tension between these two extremes and feel stuck. GRIT offers a third
        path: <strong>honest emotional awareness + disciplined action + purpose-driven strength</strong>.

      <h2>The Three Pillars of GRIT</h2>
      <p class="about-section-intro">
        Everything in GRIT is built on three pillars that reinforce each other. You don’t live life
        in separate boxes, and your growth shouldn’t either.
      </p>

      <div class="pillar-cards">
        <article class="pillar-card">
          <div class="pillar-icon pillar-physical-icon">1</div>
          <h3>Physical Strength</h3>
          <p>
            Strength you can actually use in real life. Short, realistic workouts, recovery tools,
            and movement that supports your energy instead of draining it.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simple routines that fit busy schedules</li>
            <li>Sleep and recovery basics</li>
            <li>Training that supports mental and spiritual stability</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="pillar-card">
          <div class="pillar-icon pillar-mental-icon">2</div>
          <h3>Mental Strength</h3>
          <p>
            Clarity, resilience, and emotional awareness. Not pretending you’re fine — learning how
            to stay steady when life shakes you.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tools for stress, anxiety, and overload</li>
            <li>Grounding and reframing practices</li>
            <li>Learning to respond instead of react</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Spiritual Strength</h3>
          <p>
            Purpose, identity, and integrity — however you define it. Living by the values that
            matter most to you, even when things get loud.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Who you are becoming beneath the noise</li>
            <li>Aligning beliefs and daily choices</li>
            <li>Room to wrestle with faith and questions honestly</li>

      <h2>What Makes GRIT Different</h2>
      <div class="about-grid">
        <div class="about-grid-item">
          <h3>Realistic, not idealistic</h3>
          <p>
            GRIT is built for men with jobs, kids, school, faith, and real constraints — not for
            people living in a highlight reel.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-grid-item">
          <h3>Whole-person focus</h3>
          <p>
            Physical, mental, and spiritual strength are treated as connected. You don’t have to
            choose between the gym, your mind, and your soul.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-grid-item">
          <h3>Action-first</h3>
          <p>
            Short, doable steps you can start today — not endless theory. GRIT is built around
            experiments you can run in your real life.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-grid-item">
          <h3>Values-driven</h3>
          <p>
            Strength without arrogance. Discipline without ego. GRIT is about integrity, not image.

          <li>Men carrying real responsibility for work, family, or community</li>
          <li>Men who want character and competence, not just aesthetics</li>
          <li>Men with faith or meaning questions who still care about integrity</li>

        GRIT supports your growth — it doesn’t replace licensed professionals or emergency services
        when they’re needed.

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>What GRIT Is Becoming</h2>
      <p>GRIT is growing in phases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A core library of actionable videos and articles</li>
        <li>A therapist finder experience to help men seek support</li>
        <li>Structured memberships with challenges and coaching</li>
        <li>Eventually, a full mobile app with tracking and AI-guided support</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is just the beginning. GRIT will continue to evolve with real feedback, research, and
        the needs of the men who show up.

        <h2>Strength Built Within</h2>
        <p>
          GRIT is about helping men carry what life asks of them — with resilience, clarity,
          purpose, and strength that lasts. Not because someone else demands it, but because
          that’s who you choose to become.
