      These are composite stories based on patterns we see in real men – not exact individuals.
      As GRIT grows, this page will include real member stories (with their permission).

    <article class="story-card">
      <h2 class="story-title">“I was fried, not lazy.”</h2>
      <p class="story-tagline">35, married, kids, full-time work + school</p>
      <p class="story-body">
        He thought he was just unmotivated. In reality, he was running on fumes – work, kids,
        school, and no recovery. GRIT helped him start with 7-minute movement sessions and a
        basic sleep reset. No six-pack, no magic. Just enough momentum to feel like a man who
        could carry his load again.

    <article class="story-card">
      <h2 class="story-title">“I didn’t know how to say what I felt.”</h2>
      <p class="story-tagline">28, engaged, wrestling with anger and shutdown</p>
      <p class="story-body">
        He wasn’t trying to be distant. He just didn’t have language for what was going on
        inside. Grounding exercises, therapist support, and GRIT reflections gave him a way to
        name his stress before it exploded or went silent. His relationships didn’t suddenly
        become perfect, but they became honest.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="story-card">
      <h2 class="story-title">“Faith, doubt, and still showing up.”</h2>
      <p class="story-tagline">40, long-time believer, now questioning</p>
      <p class="story-body">
        He didn’t want to lose his faith or his integrity. GRIT’s spiritual pillar helped him
        keep showing up to his values while wrestling honestly with his questions. No one told
        him what to believe. The focus was on who he was becoming in the middle of the wrestle.
