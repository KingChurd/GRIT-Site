# GRIT Website

This is a static, multi-page frontend for the GRIT brand: a space for men to build mental, physical, and spiritual strength.

## Structure

- index.html – landing page
- pricing.html – membership tiers
- therapists.html – find a therapist info
- blog.html – articles
- pillar-mental.html – Mental Strength pillar
- pillar-physical.html – Physical Strength pillar
- pillar-spiritual.html – Spiritual Strength pillar
- about.html, contact.html, privacy.html, terms.html – brand & legal
- video-library.html, account.html, press.html, roadmap.html – app-aligned pages
- start-here.html, faq.html, coaching.html, resources.html, stories.html, merch.html – support and community pages

All pages share a common navbar, footer, and styling from `style.css`.

You can deploy this folder as-is with GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static host.
