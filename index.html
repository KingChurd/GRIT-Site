      <h2>Who GRIT is for</h2>
      <div class="home-two-col">
        <p>
          GRIT is for men who are done pretending everything is fine, but also don’t want to live in
          constant crisis mode. Men who care about strength, responsibility, and integrity — even when
          life feels heavy or confusing.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Men balancing school, work, family, and faith</li>
          <li>Men who feel tired of “all or nothing” approaches</li>
          <li>Men who want character and competence, not just aesthetics</li>
          <li>Men who prefer honesty and practicality over hype</li>

    <!-- DISCLAIMER / CLARITY -->
    <section class="home-section home-section-alt">
      <h2>What GRIT is — and what it isn’t</h2>
      <p>
        GRIT is a framework, a set of tools, and a collection of resources to help men grow. It’s here
        to support your physical, mental, and spiritual strength — not to replace therapy, medical
        care, or crisis services.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Not a licensed therapy or medical service</li>
        <li>Not a crisis or emergency resource</li>
        <li>Not about perfection or performance</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        If you are in crisis or thinking about harming yourself: call or text <strong>988</strong> in
        the U.S., contact your local emergency number (such as <strong>911</strong>), or go to the
        nearest emergency room.
